# Übersicht OmniFocus Due/Past Due Task Widget
OmniFocus Flagged Due/Past Due Task Widget - Made for [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/)

This is a fork of original [flagged task](https://github.com/fitzagard/omnifocus-widget) widget meant to display due and past due tasks instead of flagged ones.

A common workflow for OF users is to flag tasks they are working on `today`. See current flagged items with a quick snapshot of the project, context and note for each task.

## Requirements

- Have [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) installed.
- OS X Yosemite: The task widget depends on the JavaScript for Automation which is new in Yosemite. Sorry, I never bothered to learn AppleScript


## Future Plans

- Include Past Due Count and Tasks
- Include Simple Forecast View
